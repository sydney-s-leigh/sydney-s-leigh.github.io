> In over 15 years in various different industries, mainly government, I've been a jack of all trades sort. Over my career, I've touched on most aspects of small business, academia, corporate business, critical infrastructure & embedded devices (SCADA), the healthcare industry, and federal government of the United States. I've been everything from a code monkey to an auditor to a pen tester and had leadership roles in several positions, including helping hire people. My dream job is being a shareholder for a living, but until I get the capital to do that cybersecurity is the next best thing. I'm particularly interested in roles that will allow me to be a lead auditor or transition into a CSO/CISO.
